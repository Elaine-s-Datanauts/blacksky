The following is the script used to present the project.

SLIDE 01 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone, I'm Saarah and I'm excited to share Project Black Sky.

Our mission: To detect suspicious behavior by combining orbital data, anomaly detection, and space weather impact analysis.

Think of it as a "Spy satellite fingerprint spotting" for when satellites behave oddly compare to their peers.

SLIDE 02 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We start by pulling satellite orbital data from Space Track and metadata from the UCS Satellite Database.

We cleaned, deduplicated, and merged them into three key outputs:

	• anomalous_rows.csv – containing event-level records of anomalies
	• scores.csv – containing satellite-level suspiciousness scores
	• dailies.csv – containing daily anomaly counts and trends

These files feed directly into Power BI for analysis.

SLIDE 03 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's walkthrough the interactive dashboard in Power BI.

On the left, you can see interactive filters. We can slice the satellites by orbit class – GEO, HEO, LEO, or MEO. We can also filter by risk points, overall suspiciousness score, or anomaly flags like outlier behavior, persistent red flags, or whether a fresh anomaly was recently detected.

At the center, the big KPI card shows the total number of satellites currently being tracked – in this snapshot, that’s 16,457 objects.

Below that, we’ve got a distribution chart of satellites by risk score, so we can quickly see how many are sitting in the higher risk categories.

On the right, we have a detailed table of satellites. This includes orbit type, NORAD ID, satellite name, and country of registry. The table is fully filterable – so if I select, for example, only high-risk GEO satellites, this view updates instantly to show me just those objects.

Finally, at the bottom, we’ve added a reset button, so analysts can clear all filters and return to the full global picture with a single click.

SLIDE 04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On this page, we’ve drilled down into a single high-risk satellite.

You can see on the left, I’ve filtered for MEO orbit, risk score 4, and selected NORAD ID 13070. That leaves us with just one satellite flagged in this view.

In the center KPI card, it confirms only 1 total satellite matches these filters.

On the right side table, we now see the time series of orbital parameters across multiple epochs for this object.

Columns like RAAN Drift, Eccentricity Drift, Inclination Drift, Mean Motion Drift, and Drag Term show how its orbit is changing over time.

The score column captures how suspicious each snapshot looks relative to peers.

This layout allows us to track how a satellite’s behavior evolves. For example, sudden large RAAN drift values or consistent negative scoring could indicate persistent unusual movement.

Down at the bottom, we still have anomaly toggles – Outlier Behavior, Persistent Red Flags, and Fresh Anomalies – which let analysts highlight specific types of irregularities.


SLIDE 05 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page gives us the bigger picture of anomaly activity over time.

Across the top line chart, we’re tracking the average anomaly fraction by orbit class — GEO, HEO, LEO, and MEO.

Notice the spikes in May and June 2025. These jumps suggest clusters of satellites simultaneously showing unusual behavior, which could align with environmental or coordinated events.

At the bottom, we’ve got a heatmap of rolling 7-day anomaly intensity.

Each row is a satellite (by NORAD ID), and each column is a day in the rolling window.

Dark red cells, like we see for satellite 12303, highlight sustained, high-intensity anomalies.

In contrast, most satellites remain pale blue, indicating little or no anomaly activity.

This view makes it easy to spot both broad trends across orbit classes and specific satellites that stand out for persistent abnormal behavior.

Our full pipeline and dashboard are open-sourced on GitHub under the datathon-2025 repo.

So anyone can reproduce or extend the work.
